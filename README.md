~Description on assignment
—-
The following assignment is based on refactoring already existing code that doesn't quite fit accessibility guidelines. Upon inspection it was apparent many things needed to be updated. Broken links and a lot of repetitive code that was unnecessarily congesting the code.

~Improvements
—-
-Clear web title that was added to improve search optimization.
-Better accessibility by including  ``alt`` tags.
- Changed html  to have semantic html structure.
-Adding  a  ``header`` that included ``nav`` links, with ``aside`` and ``main`` content separated into their own  ``sections`` and ``footer``  contain the copyright and site credits.
*-The  improved semantic html structure will allow for an easier to understand and more approachable search engine optimization.
-Css has also been updated to stop repetitiveness of “ids” and “classes”.
